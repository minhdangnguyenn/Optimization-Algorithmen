# Optimization Algorithmen - 2D Rectangle Packing Problem

**Module**: Optimization Algorithm  
**Course Project**: WS 2526

## Project Overview
The **2D Rectangle Packing Problem** is a classical **combinatorial optimization problem** and a variant of the **Bin Packing Problem**, which is known to be **NP-complete**.

Given a finite set of rectangles and identical square bins (boxes), the objective is to place all rectangles into the minimum number of bins such that:

- Each rectangle is fully contained within a bin
- Rectangles do not overlap
- Rectangles may be rotated by 90 degrees (if allowed)

## Optimization Goal

Depending on the formulation, the objective can be:

- **Minimize the number of bins used**, or
- **Maximize space utilization** of the bins
